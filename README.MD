# [Breach 5 License Generator](https://shining-concepts.github.io/breach5licensegenerator/)

In *[The Vigil Files: Case 1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makario.vigilos)*, the player is required to generate a license for the fictional Breach 5 application. This is a simple static web page providing them a way to do that, based on the Lua code provided in the in-game "gen_license.txt" file.

Written for [/r/VigilFilesWalkthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/VigilFilesWalkthrough/), specifically for the [Chapter 7 walkthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/VigilFilesWalkthrough/comments/ifqkt6/chapter_7_walkthrough_the_vigil_files_case_1/), as the license generation task occurs during the 7th chapter of the game.
